                The request object.
                A request message for
                RegionTargetHttpsProxies.SetUrlMap. See
                the method description for details.

            ~.compute.Operation:
                Represents an Operation resource.

                Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources:

                -  `Global </compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/globalOperations>`__
                   \*
                   `Regional </compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations>`__
                   \*
                   `Zonal </compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations>`__

                You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous
                API requests. For more information, read Handling API
                responses.

                Operations can be global, regional or zonal.

                -  For global operations, use the ``globalOperations``
                   resource.
                -  For regional operations, use the ``regionOperations``
                   resource.
                -  For zonal operations, use the ``zonalOperations``
                   resource.

                For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal
                Resources. (== resource_for
